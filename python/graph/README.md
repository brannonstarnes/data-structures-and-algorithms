# Graphs

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Creates an implementation of a Graph, Vertices, Edges and associated methods.

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Conduct Test Driven Development while developing an implemenation of a Graph.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Test Driven Development utilized, with predetermined tests provided.

## API

<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->

-   add_node(value) - Adds a node to the Graph instance. Returns added node
-   add_edge(start_vertex, end_vertex, weight = 0) - Adds a new edge between nodes with an optional weight.
-   get_nodes() - Returns all nodes (vertices) in the Graph instance.
-   get_neighbors(vertex) - Returns a collection of edges connected to the node (vertex)
-   size() - Returns number of nodes in the Graph instance.

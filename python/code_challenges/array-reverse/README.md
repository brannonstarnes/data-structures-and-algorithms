## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The current approch involved using a for loop to iterate through each element of the list and assign it to a new list, starting at the final index position and working bacwards. Using this singular for loop the Big O value is O(n), since the implementation time would grow linearly.
